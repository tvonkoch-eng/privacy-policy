<h2>Introduction</h2>

If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the App.</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p><strong>Account Creation is Optional: You can use the App without creating an account. Most features, including AI date recommendations and restaurant discovery, are available without registration. Account creation is only required for features that require personal data storage, such as saving dates, syncing preferences across devices, and connecting with a partner.</strong></p>
<p>We may collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create an Account<strong>: When you register for an account, we collect your email address and authentication information. You can sign in using:</li>
</ul>
<p>  - <strong>Email and Password<strong>: We collect your email address and a securely hashed password.</p>
<p>  - <strong>Sign in with Apple<strong>: We collect your name and email address. Apple Sign-In allows you to use "Hide My Email" to keep your email address private. We only receive the information you choose to share through Apple Sign-In.</p>
<p>  - <strong>Sign in with Google<strong>: We collect your name and email address from your Google account.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete Onboarding<strong>: We collect information such as your city, age range, relationship status, hobbies, budget preferences, preferred cuisines, and transportation preferences. Onboarding is optional and can be skipped.</li>
<li><strong>Use the App<strong>: We collect information about your preferences, dining history, favorite cuisines, price range preferences, and feedback on recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Location Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Location data collection is optional. We only collect your location data when you grant permission to access your device's location services.</li>
<li>The App is fully functional without location services. When location is enabled, it is used to provide location-based restaurant and activity recommendations.</li>
<li>We use location data only when the App is in use ("When In Use" permission).</li>
<li>Location data is cached locally on your device and may be stored in our database to improve recommendations when location services are enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device Information<strong>: We may collect information about your device, including device ID, device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.</li>
<li><strong>Usage Data<strong>: We collect information about how you interact with the App, including the features you use, recommendations you view, and feedback you provide.</li>
<li><strong>Log Data<strong>: We may collect log information when you use the App, including IP address, access times, and app features accessed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analytics and Tracking Data</h3>
<p>We use Firebase Analytics (provided by Google) to collect analytics data that helps us understand how users interact with the App and improve our services. The analytics data we collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App Usage Events<strong>: We track when you open the App, complete onboarding, view restaurant recommendations, select categories, and create dates.</li>
<li><strong>Interaction Events<strong>: We track which restaurant recommendations you click on, which links you use (directions, menu, website), and which date types you create.</li>
<li><strong>Event Parameters<strong>: Some events include associated data such as restaurant names, link types (directions, menu, website), and date types (first date, classic, staged, day trip, surprise, at home).</li>
<li><strong>User Identification<strong>: When you are logged in, we may associate your user ID with analytics events to understand usage patterns across sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Device and Technical Information<strong>: Analytics automatically collects device information, app version, and technical data necessary for analytics processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This analytics data is collected automatically when you use the App and is processed by Google Firebase Analytics. The data helps us understand user behavior, improve app functionality, and enhance user experience. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized for analysis purposes.</p>
